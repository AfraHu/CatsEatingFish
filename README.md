## English-Listening-and-Speaking
  - After the preparations above, you've got a firm foundation in English, but you've been more theoretical than explicit in your knowledge.
  - To speak English fluently, you need to practice your instinctive understanding of the language.
  - Watching your favorite English movies or TV shows and following the actresses or actors to repeat their lines. It is called \"影子跟读\" in Chinese.
  - In my experience, it is better to print the lines down on paper rather than using apps if you have enough spaces.

## Japanese-Grammar
